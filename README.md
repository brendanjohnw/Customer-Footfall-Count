# OpenCV People Tracker and Counter 
## A Customer Footfall Count Project.
The following project is a computer vision customer footfall counter that utilizes OpenCV for object tracking and detection. 
The detectiion mechanism was supplemented by pre-trained YoloV4 datasets, which were adapted from Common Objects in Common (COCO).

The main application of the project was to count the in-rate and out-rate of people enterring a particular premise such as a train station
shopping mall or retail store.
